I had issues with my rental car company and the hosts, Marco and Smaro, spent at least an hour on the phone to help me sort it out, successfully. They are very kind, sweet and helpful. Awesome villas--we stayed in the 2-story Alpha which has a balcony with a superlative view, a nice kitchen and dining area, a great bedroom upstairs and living area downstairs. It is like a home away from home in charming Crete. I strongly recommend this B&B for peace and quiet, access to a beautiful beach downhill, and centrality to visit the rest of Crete.

We had room 311 with some peeling wallpaper, but the bathroom looked to been refurbished recently and the shower was exceptionally good.

They still have a little ways to go but are coming from the right place and their kindness and friendliness make up for the small shortcomings they are still working through.  The beds are the most comfortable we slept on in our 3 week tour of Albania! The rooms are decorated in a beautiful modern minimalist style so the star of the show is the view. The individual pools are an awesome touch and when you are sitting in it looking out over the bay it is an incredible experience! The whole property is settled right into the natural\n",

This is a clean hotel with nice rooms, friendly staff and a good breakfast.  But it's cold! It's cold in the bar, it's cold in the bathroom because there's no separate heating. If you want a warm bathroom you have to leave the door to the room open and get the heat from there which is inconvenient for sleeping and probably not very economic.

It's well situated, and the host is very helpful in suggesting things to do, like walking routes for example. His best advice was to tell me to go to any restaurant in the town centre because they're all good (he was right).   If you are not fit, you should have some means for getting to and from the town centre because it's a 600m steep grade walk back to the villa.

      " Review text                 | We stayed here for 2 nights on our recent 2.5 week stay on Crete. This hotel is situated  near to Heraklion on a hillside and built to recreate a Cretan village from the past. Our room was very rustic, but there was a TV , air conditioning and a full sized fridge. The beds were comfortable, but quite low down to the floor. The pool was very refreshing and we enjoyed using it. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed the breakfast and there was something different on both days. The Dog that lives on site is called Milou and she is very friendly, really enjoys a belly rub too! There are cats on the site too, but they are ok. The only downside is the outside bar/patio due to the large tree under which it is located, this meant there were always lots of flies and bugs \n",

      " Review text                 | We stayed here for a family wedding. The location is only 15 minutes from the airport but seemed a world away! Tucked away on a winding mountain road with panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and towns. If you love animals then cats,  kittens, peacocks, goats, a chatty parrot and cuddly dog are waiting for you! The staff and owners are friendly and helpful. A shout out to Christina and the bar tender who went above and beyond to chat, show card tricks and teach us some Greek words. The rooms are rustic and traditional but have air con and are clean. Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Tucked away on a winding mountain road with panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and towns. If you love animals then cats, kittens, peacocks, goats, a chatty parrot and cuddly dog are waiting for you! The staff and owners are friendly and helpful. A shout out to Christina and the bar tender who went above and beyond to chat, show card tricks and teach us some Greek words. The rooms are rustic and traditional but have air con and are clean. Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Clean rooms, wonderful architecture, the water in the shower is not too warm, in the evening it takes some time to get from very cold to okay temperatures, but it‘s fine. The aircondition works really well, the fridge is clean and cool. The pool is nice, the tables outside the restaurant provide a wonderful view over lots of green, the sea and mountains further away.

      " Review text                 | This is designed as a traditional Cretan village and I guess it fulfils that brief. However, it is a mix of good and bad. You need a certain level of fitness to navigate the many steps around the site and there is absolutely nowhere to go without transport unless you want to walk along a very busy road. No buses and cost 30 Euros for a taxi into Heraklion. Water was consistently hot and rooms kept clean but bed was pretty hard and a hand held shower.  All the staff are friendly and pleasant but the food, although plentiful, was pretty average although Moussaka was best I have tasted! Bar staff were excellent.  All in all I can't give more than 3 stars but OK if you want basic accommodation in the area and spend a lot of time off site.                                             \n",

No buses and cost 30 Euros for a taxi into Heraklion. Water was consistently hot and rooms kept clean but bed was pretty hard and a hand held shower. All the staff are friendly and pleasant but the food although plentiful was pretty average although Moussaka was best I have tasted. Bar staff were excellent. All in all I ca n't give more than 3 stars but OK if you want basic accommodation in the area and spend a lot of time off site.                                                \n",

We attended the Easter day sermon at the picturesque chapel that exists within the grounds of the resort. The bell was ringing and the people were chanting uplifting our spirit regardless our personal beliefs. After that it was Perhaps 2 o'clock and we went for the Traditional Easter lunch . The food and the service was excellent plenty to drink and Eat. It was a set price  They had a Traditional Cretan band playing and after a couple drinks almost everybody was dancing. Just a remark Perhaps for next year.

      " Review text                 | We had a room quite near to the road, but it had the most amazing view over both the city and the surrounding mountains. We sat on the balcony most evenings watching the sunset. The 'village' is on the side of a hill and has many steps but you soon get used to them. It was probably the most attractive village we saw on our holiday.  Our room was big with a nice bathroom. Beds were comfy which is rare in Greece! The taverna or the café were open every day for food which is good, basic fare but well cooked and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Thoroughly recommend. We'll certainly be back.                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      " Review text                 | We stayed here for 5 nights for our anniversary, beautiful grounds and amazing food. Friendly staff. Only reason for 4 stars because of our room had loads of ants and on our balcony was loads of wasps. ( my husbands back was full of bug bites) we still had an amazing time. I would recommend to rent a car when staying here as in the middle of no where. ( which we loved) I would recommend this hotel. My husband fell in love with the hotel dogs. There is also lots of cats here. The views was amazing. The restaurant was one of the most romantic restaurants we have ever been too. On Wednesday evenings they do a Cretan night with free wine, what ever you do don’t miss this night as was wonderful to watch.
